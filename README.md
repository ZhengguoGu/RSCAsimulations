# RSCAsimulations
This project contains all the simulations studies done by means of the RSCA package

This project serves the following purposes:

1. [For users of RSCA] To understand the performance of the algorithms in RSCA, and to evaluate whether RSCA is useful. 

2. [For maintainers of RSCA] To record and test algorithms of RSCA. (Note that here we focus on how well the algorithms perform. In the future, more model selection methods will be included, we would like to compare their differences in terms of recovering the variables etc.)
